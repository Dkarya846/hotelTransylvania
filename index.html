          The film tells the story of Count Dracula, the owner of a hotel called
          Hotel Transylvania where the world's monsters can take a rest from
          human civilization. Dracula invites some of the most famous monsters
          to celebrate the 118th birthday of his daughter Mavis (with an 18 year
          old aspect). When the "human-free hotel" is unexpectedly visited by an
          ordinary 21-year-old traveler named Jonathan, Drac must do everything
          in his power to prevent Mavis from falling in love with him before the
          hotel's guests learn a human is in the castle, which may jeopardize
          the hotel's future and his career.
