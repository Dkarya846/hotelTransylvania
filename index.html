          The film tells the story of Count Dracula, the owner of a hotel called
          Hotel Transylvania where the world's monsters can take a rest from
          human civilization. Dracula invites some of the most famous monsters
          to celebrate the 118th birthday of his daughter Mavis (with an 18 year
          old aspect). When the "human-free hotel" is unexpectedly visited by an
          ordinary 21-year-old traveler named Jonathan, Drac must do everything
          in his power to prevent Mavis from falling in love with him before the
          hotel's guests learn a human is in the castle, which may jeopardize
          the hotel's future and his career.

          In 1895 and the aftermath of his deceased wife Martha (Jackie Sandler)
          at the hands of an angry human mob, Count Dracula (Adam Sandler)
          commissions and builds a massive 5-star, monsters-only hotel in
          Transylvania, in which he raises his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) and
          to serve as a safe haven and a getaway for the world's monsters from
          fear of human persecution. Famous monsters such as Frankenstein (Kevin
          James) and his wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), Wayne and Wanda Werewolf
          (Steve Buscemi and Molly Shannon) and their massive immediate family,
          Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade), and Murray the Mummy (CeeLo
          Green) often come to stay at the hotel.
          <br /><br />
          In the present day on Mavis' 118th birthday, Dracula allows his
          daughter to leave the castle to explore the human world, but he sets
          up an elaborate plan using his zombie bellhops disguised as humans to
          make them seem intimidating, and frighten her home. The plan works,
          but the zombies inadvertently lead a 21-year-old human Jonathan
          "Johnny" Loughran (Andy Samberg) back to the hotel. Drac frantically
          disguises him as a Frankensteinesque monster and passes him off as
          Frank's cousin "Johnnystein". Jonathan soon encounters Mavis and the
          two "Zing". Unable to get Johnny out of the hotel without notice, Drac
          quickly improvises that Johnny is a party planner, brought in to bring
          a fresher approach to his own traditional and boring parties. Johnny
          quickly becomes a hit to the other monsters, but this disgusts and
          worries Drac greatly. Drac orders Johnny to leave, but he is brought
          back by Mavis. After being shown the beauty of a sunrise by Johnny,
          Mavis is inspired to give humans another chance.
